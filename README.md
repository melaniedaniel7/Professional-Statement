## About Me
My passion for cybersecurity began when I was exploring degree options at my university. Despite not having any prior IT experience, the course description immediately intrigued me—it seemed like a field that was not only fascinating but also important and different from anything I’d encountered. What excites me most about cybersecurity is the combination of solving complex problems, protecting sensitive data, and, ultimately, protecting people. I believe cybersecurity is essential in today’s society as we rely so heavily on technology, yet many, especially older generations, are unaware of the dangers lurking online. I am particularly driven by the desire to shield people from online exploitation and find the psychology behind social engineering attacks—both the motivations of attackers and the behavior of victims—endlessly interesting.

I have a strong sense of justice and want to play an active role in defending individuals and organizations from these threats. The fast-paced nature of cybersecurity is another aspect that draws me in; it ensures I’ll always be learning and adapting, keeping me mentally stimulated and engaged. I’m excited to learn coding and apply it to real-world scenarios, and I value the balance between working independently and collaborating with a team, particularly in high-pressure situations like data breaches. Cybersecurity will also allow me to develop critical soft skills, such as communication and active listening, which are vital when managing incidents in stressful environments.

Finally, the global nature of cybersecurity presents opportunities for me to expand my horizons and move overseas, combining my career goals with my desire for new cultural experiences. All of these elements make cybersecurity not only a field of interest but also a lifelong pursuit aligned with my core values and strengths.
